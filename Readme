The app has three input event buttons that require the user 
to enter the input. User plays by entering a number not less than 16 into grid.
The grid displays the rows entered by the user into the container.
The second button changes the background color and the third erases everything
in the container.
The link is at the bottom incase you want to refer the code in Github.
Welcome.
